# Eat-Da-Burger! App
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ogmedina/burger)

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they imagine. It is a burger logger app with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern and is hosted on Heroku. After submitting the name of said delicous burger, the left side is filled with the name inputted. Once the button is pressed to "Devour It", it is moved to the right side and has been 'consumed'. The app will store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not.
